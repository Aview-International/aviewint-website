        How We Protect Your Personal Data
      </h2>

        In order to protect your security, we use the strongest available

        facilities. All data is only accessible to our employees. Our employees
        are bound by strict confidentiality agreements and a breach of this
        agreement would result in the employee&#39;s termination.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is
        secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of
        harm. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and therefore we
        are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is
        reasonably practical.
