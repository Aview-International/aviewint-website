If you have high expectations of what the contractor delivers, it's not wrong to ask for a discount on the job. You can get the best deal if you prepare your negotiation with accurate information and informed knowledge.",

You may even be able to find them for free if you offer internship opportunities. However, interns don't offer the same experience as editors who have been doing it as a career.",

Imagine you have an exceptional script with phenomenal footage filmed from multiple angles by someone with experience. In that case, the only thing holding back your video from being excellent is its audio quality — and that's where great editors come in handy. In this case, it would be wise to pay the extra bucks for an experienced editor to get the best video possible.",

If this isn't possible or practical because there aren't many editors with these skills, consider hiring a different type of editor who is familiar with this kind of work but not necessarily all the experience needed.",

You might go with someone who charges by the project or by the hour, but make sure you know what kind of edit you want them to do beforehand so everyone can be on the same page about what will happen. You also want someone who understands how long it will take and how much work will go into editing each type of project before they start working with you.
